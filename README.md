# AT&T Spam Detector

Sous forme de notebook, Ã©tude d'un dataset regroupant des messages type sms recus par des clients AT&T ayant ensuite Ã©tÃ© classÃ©s en 2 catÃ©gories : spam our ham (non spam).

Objectif du projet : CrÃ©ez un modÃ¨le d'apprentissage profond capable de signaler automatiquement les spams en fonction du contenu des messages.

Outils : utilisation d'un modÃ¨le de Deep Learning afin de rÃ©aliser ces prÃ©dictions.

# SPAM detector
# Company's Description ðŸ“‡

AT&T Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications holding company headquartered at Whitacre Tower in Downtown Dallas, Texas. It is the world's largest telecommunications company by revenue and the third largest provider of mobile telephone services in the U.S. As of 2022, AT&T was ranked 13th on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations, with revenues of $168.8 billion! ðŸ˜®

# Project ðŸš§

One of the main pain point that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

# Goals ðŸŽ¯

Your goal is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based solely on the sms' content.

# Deliverable ðŸ“¬

To complete this project, your team should:

    Write a notebook that runs preprocessing and trains one or more deep learning models in order to predict the spam or ham nature of the sms
    State the achieved performance clearly
